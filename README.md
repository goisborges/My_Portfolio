# My_Portfolio
my portfolio using Swift

This a portfolio project using Swift and Xcode.

It uses several Swift technologies for training and also to showcase my knowledge.

I am using SwiftUI for this project. As part of the contents it has: a few animations, a connection to a weather API to retrieve and show current weather data for the city the users searches, @State variables and Bindings, white/dark mode option, and a view (SceneView) that shows a few 3D models created by myself on Blender.

I have been adding more content as I move on with a bootcamp course I am currently taking to improve my skills.

If you're looking for a new talent for your company, a responsive employee, and a very eager to learn professional, please feel free to contact me as I am currently seeking for an opportunity to be part of a dev team.

Thank you!
